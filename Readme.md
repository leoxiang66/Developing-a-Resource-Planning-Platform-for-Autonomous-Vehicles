The resource planner computes an architectural proposal based on predefined optimization goals for an autonomous driving vehicle by collecting system properties and AI-based application requirements. In case of dynamic reconfiguration, e.g. when the vehicle changes from the highway to city traffic or when drives in a tunnel, the resource planner can kill running individual algorithms based on the context as well as launching other algorithms while ensuring the whole process in terms of functional safety. In this lab course, It is planned to implement a context-based resource planner while considering the computation, communication ans safety aspects. Different groups of students will be assigned to work on different modules of this resource planner, from perception unit to the core of the resouce planner itself.
